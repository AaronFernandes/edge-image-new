        <p>“I have been self employed for 7 years and am currently the Director of 4 separate companies. As a young entrepreneur I need to be sure that I am portraying the correct image to my clientele. I decided that I needed to get professional advice on the best way to dress for my industry. Alison was extremely professional, well presented and confident in her knowledge. She provided me with a detailed consultation of exactly what I needed to do and have been confident to do so ever since. Alison helped me to make better decisions when shopping and taught me new ways to wear my current wardrobe. I would recommend Alison at Edge Style and Image Consultants to anyone who needs from a little bit of advise to a major wardrobe overhaul!”<br />

<p>Alison has a lovely combination of warmth and honesty that makes it easy to open up to her and listen to her advice. Alison has a great, modern eye for what looks good, and helped me further understand my own shape and what really suits me; I have already made some overdue changes accordingly. Alison is a very safe pair of hands and I recommend her to any woman looking to improve her total &#8216;look&#8217; and raise confidence.<br />

<p>I have known Alison for many years and it has always struck me she has a great sense of style and natural flair.  When Alison decided to become an Image Consultant, I was first in line to find out if I had been unknowingly making some wrong choices with colour and style.  Her sensitivity and easy going manner made the experience very enjoyable, positive as well as educational and I have been shopping with new confidence ever since.</p>
<p>I also recommended the experience to some friends and they have already taken up the experience of a consultation and are now enjoying the new confidence it has given them.<br />

<p>After loosing a substantial amount of weight I found myself with a new body shape. While I was always confident in my dress style, I found many of my clothes no longer suited me, so I decided to engage Alison&#8217;s expertise as a colour and style consultant . The whole process  of reviewing my existing wardrobe and giving me a new look was enlightening.  I came away with a better understanding of colours and styles that suit my body and personality.  Alison was honest and warm with her feedback and really listened to me, which came through in her recommendations. I would highly recommend Alison and her services to anyone wanting advice and guidance with their colour and styling.<br />
